```


### Requirements

#### config.ini content
```
[DB]
server = 127.0.0.1
username = SA
password = Mg.13579
prevent_duplicate = 1

[GENERAL]
all = 1

```
> You should fill correct DB information here.

#### Source contents
```
[TABLE]
name = dbo.Example

[FILE_SERVER]
host = ftp.example.com
username = example
password = example
# If True or 1, then it uses SFTP, else it uses FTP
use_ssl = True
# This is the root path. We can make it empty. In that case, ftp server default path will be used.
# Empty is working. If you want to set it anyway, this is the example usage: folder = /Home/example/
folder = /Home/example
parse_file = assumed_names.txt
```

$ docker build . -t image-parser
$ docker run --net=host -v $(pwd)/config:/config image-parser
```

> These are the libraries needed.

#### Assumptions
- All table contents are same. Only change is the table name.
- Collin is not reachable from development. Hence it is assumed that it connects to correct folder and the only xml in zip is what we need. 

#### Comments
- Bexar is taking too long to download file.
- Bexar file structure is too complicated and badly organized.
